## Why did you make this?

Who else has fantasized before about having a clean UI social network like for GitHub? Being able to browse repos in a stylish manner...:grin: well, I have and that's why i'm making it come to live with gitsocial.

If you have ever fantasized or like the idea about this, come join me, let's make this thing happen:sunglasses:

I'm using the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) for the data.
